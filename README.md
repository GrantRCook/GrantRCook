- 👋 Hi, I’m @GrantRCook
- 👀 I’m interested in Reading, traveling as much as possible with my wife, being involved in my church, drawing/animating whenever possible, and playing video games with an impactful story.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, Tableau, Python, Microsoft BI, and Microsoft Excel.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on SQL to collect data and present it to a client efficiently.
